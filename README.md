# Foxlab Pi Installer for GitLab CE on a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB)
This shell script will automate the process of installing GitLab CE 12.6.2 for the Raspberry Pi as well as configuring the install so that it will run properly. The [FoxLab Pi Wiki](https://github.com/k0d3x8its/FoxLabPi/wiki) has manual instructions for installing GitLab CE 12.6.2 as well as a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVp0buV-wVM) provided by Mikrocontoller Projekte.

A big thanks goes out to [Mikrocontoller Projekte]() for creating the [GitLab Raspberry Pi]().
